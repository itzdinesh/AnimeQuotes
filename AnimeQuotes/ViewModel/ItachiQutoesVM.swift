If you do, failure is certain" , "Change is impossible in this fog of ignorance." , "Those who turn their heads against their comrades are sure to die a terrible death. Be prepared." , "He who forgives and acknowledges himself, that is what it truly means to be strong!" , "We do not know what kind of people we truly are until the moment before our deaths. As death comes to embrace you, you will realize what you are. That’s what death is, don’t you think?" , "Becoming the Hokage doesn't mean people will acknowledge you. But when the people acknowledge you, you can become Hokage. Never forget your friends!" ]

Not You Or Anyone Can Change That.”" , "“I Hate A Lot Of Things, And I Don't Particularly Like Anything.”" , "“Having Too Many Bonds Causes One To Lose Focus, Weakening Their Strongest Wish, Their Greatest Desire.”" , "“What I Have Is Not A Dream, Because I Will Make It A Reality.

Be yourself and you’ll be fine.”" , "“Stay focused. Never avert your eyes, because if an opening arises, even our insignificant power may be enough to determine the fate of the world.” " , "“Oh man... those clouds are so lucky. So free. More to the point, I didn’t feel like doing this in the first place. And I only became a ninja because I thought life would’ve been more interesting as one... I suppose things aren’t gonna be that simple.”" , "“How many times do I have to tell you? The first move is always a feint. It’s the most basic thing, to land a hit with the second move.” "  , "It really doesn’t matter to me if I ever become a chūnin or not, but I guess I shouldn’t let myself be beaten by a female, so let’s do it." , "“I know I usually seem like a pretty lazy guy, but not today. Because now, I’m responsible for your lives too.”" , "“It’s not because I’m lazy, it’s just because I don’t care.”" , "“Don’t you think it’s about time for us to be the ones who entrust, not the entrusted. It’s a drag, but I can’t say that.”" , "“Laziness is the mother of all bad habits, but ultimately she is a mother and we should respect her.”" , "“Ughh. Great. What’s the point in setting the alarm if I’m going to wake up before it goes off? What a total waste. Now I’ve gotta shut it off but I don’t feel like moving. But if I don’t shut it off it will just keep ringing and ringing. Sigh. It makes me tired just thinking about the whole thing. Some mornings are such a drag...” "]

I don’t want to be anyone." , "There is no such thing as peace in this world—that is reality." , "Wherever light strikes, there will always be shadows. So as long as there is a concept of victors, the vanquished will also similarly exist." , "You know, everyone actually shall eventually just end up like me." , "I am Obito Uchiha and I will surpass you once I awaken my Sharingan!" , " This world is completely worthless. There is nothing left in it but misery." , " You’ll probably have to suffer again from now on, but don’t change. Keep going your way." , "You remind me of myself, Naruto. Yeah, just like when I was young, but that’s all changed with time."  , "What will I gain from criticizing this absurd reality?" , "Look at me! There is nothing in my heart! I don’t feel pain any longer." ]
